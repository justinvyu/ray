# Scaling Batch Inference with Ray Data

This template walks through GPU batch inference on an image dataset using a PyTorch ResNet model.

By the end, we will have classified > 3000 images using the pre-trained ResNet model and saved these predictions to a local directory.

When the workspace is up and running, start coding by clicking on the Jupyter or VSCode icon above. Open the `batch_inference.ipynb` file and follow the instructions there.
